/* Task 1
In this first task, Little Lemon need you to create a procedure that displays the maximum ordered 
quantity in the Orders table. 

Creating this procedure will allow Little Lemon to reuse the logic implemented in the procedure 
easily without retyping the same code over again and again to check the maximum quantity.
*/
USE little_lemon_db;
CREATE PROCEDURE IF NOT EXISTS GetMaxQuantity()  
SELECT MAX(quantity) FROM orders;

CALL GetMaxQuantity();


/* Task 2
In the second task, Little Lemon need you to help them to create a prepared statement called 
GetOrderDetail. This prepared statement will help to reduce the parsing time of queries. It will 
also help to secure the database from SQL injections.

The prepared statement should accept one input argument, the CustomerID value, from a variable. 

The statement should return the order id, the quantity and the order cost from the Orders table.â€¯

Once you create the prepared statement, you can create a variable called id and assign it value of 
1. 
*/
USE little_lemon_db;
PREPARE GetOrderDetail 
FROM 'SELECT id, quantity, total_cost FROM orders WHERE id = ?';

SET @id = 1;
EXECUTE GetOrderDetail USING @id;


/* Task 3
Your third and final task is to create a stored procedure called CancelOrder. Little Lemon want to 
use this stored procedure to delete an order record based on the user input of the order id.

Creating this procedure will allow Little Lemon to cancel any order by specifying the order id value 
in the procedure parameter without typing the entire SQL delete statement.
